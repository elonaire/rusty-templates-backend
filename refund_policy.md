**Rusty Templates Refund Policy**

Thank you for purchasing our templates at Rusty Templates. We strive to ensure that our customers are satisfied with their purchases. However, if you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, we are here to help. Please read our refund policy carefully.

**1. Digital Products Refund Policy**

Due to the nature of digital products and instant accessibility, we generally do not offer refunds after a template has been downloaded or accessed. However, we do provide refunds under specific circumstances as outlined below:

**2. Eligibility for Refunds**

- **Non-Delivery of the Product:** If you do not receive the template you purchased, you are entitled to a full refund.
- **Download Issues:** If you encounter issues that prevent you from downloading or accessing the product, please contact us within 48 hours of purchase for assistance. If we are unable to resolve the issue, you are eligible for a refund.
- **Major Defects:** If there are major defects with the template that render it unusable, and we are unable to provide a replacement or fix the issue within a reasonable timeframe, you are entitled to a full refund.
- **Product Not as Described:** If the template you purchased is significantly different from the description or demo provided on our website, you may be eligible for a refund.

**3. Procedure for Refund Requests**

To request a refund, please follow these steps:

1. **Contact Us:** Email us at [info@rustytemplates.com](mailto:info@rustytemplates.com) with your order number, detailed description of the issue, and any supporting evidence (such as screenshots).
2. **Assessment:** We will review your request and associated evidence. Our team may contact you for more information if needed.
3. **Resolution:** We aim to resolve refund requests within 7 business days. If the refund is approved, it will be processed to your original method of payment. Depending on your payment provider, it may take additional time for the refund to be reflected in your account.

Refunds will not be issued for the following:

- Change of mind after the purchase has been completed.
